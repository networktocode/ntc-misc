## Tenant Policy Modules

The five modules we need in order to build contracts for our Application's End Point Groups are:

* `aci_filter`
* `aci_filter_entry`
* `aci_contract`
* `aci_contract_subject`
* `aci_contract_subject_to_filter`

Go ahead and open `03_aci_tenant_policies_pb.yml` file and we will discuss each module and look at the example provided in the playbook.

### Filter and Filter Entry Modules

The `aci_filter` module is used to manage Filter Objects on the APIC, and the `aci_filter_entry` is used to manage the Network Protocol entries that are associated with the Filters. 

Both of these modules have the `filter` parameter used to identify a particular Filter. Additionally, the `aci_filter_entry`, module as the following options:

* `entry`: The name of the Filter Entry
* `ether_type`: Sets the Ethernet type for the object; "ip" is most common option.
* `ip_protocol`: Available when the ether_type is "ip" and used to determine the IP Protocol of the object. The most common options are "tcp", "udp", and "icmp"
* `dst_port_start`: Available for TCP and UDP Filter Entries, and used to set the starting port of the destination port range
* `dst_port_end`: Available for TCP and UDP Filter Entries, and used to set the ending port of the destination port range

Look at the first two tasks in the playbook:

```yaml
    - name: ENSURE TENANT FILTERS EXIST
      aci_filter:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        action: "post"
        protocol: "https"
        tenant: "{{ tenant }}"
        filter: "{{ item }}"
        descr: "Filter Created Using Ansible"
      with_items:
        - "https"
        - "sql"

    - name: ENSURE FILTERS HAVE FILTER ENTRIES
      aci_filter_entry:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        state: "present"
        validate_certs: False
        tenant: "{{ tenant }}"
        filter: "{{ item.filter }}"
        entry: "{{ item.entry }}"
        ether_type: "ip"
        ip_protocol: "tcp"
        dst_port_start: "{{ item.port }}"
        dst_port_end: "{{ item.port }}"
      with_items:
        - filter: "https"
          entry: "https"
          port: 443
        - filter: "sql"
          entry_name: "sql"
          port: 1433
```

These tasks use a task attribute called `with_items`, that allows the task to loop over a list and check for multiple configuration items. We have two Filters that need to exist for our application, so the first task has two "items" that are filled in for the `filter` parameter.

The second task has more than one parameter that has a variable value, so we supply mappings to each field to identify which parameter gets a specific value. ACI treats each TCP/UDP filter entry as a range of ports, but since our entries have a range of one, we can use the same value for both `dest_port_start` and `dest_port_end`. Notice that the filters map back to the Filters that in the first task, so this task will ensure that each of these are assigned the correct port filter entries.

### Contract and Contract Subjects Modules

The `aci_contract` module is used to manage Contracts and the `aci_contract_subject` module is used primarily to manage what Filters are associated with a Contract.

Two of the more important options available in the `aci_contract` module are:

* `contract`: The name of the Contract object
* `scope`: Determines the scope of the Contract. The options are "context", "application-profile", "tenant", and "global". The Contract's scope determines how the Contract will be provided and consumed by the associated EPGs, and is a way to use Contracts efficiently.

> "context" is the same as VRF in contract scope

In addition to the `contract` parameter, the `aci_contract_subject` module has two parameters we make note of:

* `subject`: The name of the Contract Subject
* `reverse_filter`: Determines if the ACI Fabric should reverse the ports to allow return traffic back to the originating host, since the contracts are stateless.

```yaml
    - name: ENSURE TENANT CONTRACTS EXIST
      aci_contract:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        state: "present"
        validate_certs: False
        tenant: "{{ tenant }}"
        contract: "{{ item }}"
        scope: "context"
        description: "Contract Created Using Ansible"
      with_items:
        - "web"
        - "sql"

    - name: ENSURE CONTRACTS HAVE CONTRACT SUBJECTS
      aci_contract_subject:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        state: "present"
        validate_certs: False
        tenant: "{{ tenant }}"
        contract: "{{ item.contract }}"
        subject: "{{ item.subject }}"
      with_items:
        - contract: "web"
          subject: "https"
        - contract: "sql"
          subject: "sql"
```

These last two tasks are very similar to the previous two tasks. It is important to note that the subject_names in the `aci_contract_subject` task map to the Filters in the first task. This will ensure that the Contracts are associated to the appropriate Filters.

### Binding Contract Subjects and Filters
The last step in creating a Contract in ACI is associating the Contract Subject with a Filter Entry. The `aci_contract_subject_to_filter` module is used to form these relationships, and uses the naming paramers from `aci_contract`, `aci_contract_subject`, and `aci_filter` modules.

```yaml
    - name: ENSURE CONTRACTS SUBJECTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH FILTERS
      aci_subject_filter:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        state: "present"
        validate_certs: False
        tenant_name: "{{ tenant }}"
        contract: "{{ item.contract }}"
        subject: "{{ item.subject }}"
        filter: "{{ item.filter }}"
      with_items:
        - contract: "web"
          subject: "https"
          filter: "https"
        - contract: "sql"
          subject: "sql"
          filter: "sql"
```

## Executing the Playbook and Adding ACI Filters and Contracts

Ansible has different levels of verbosity that you can set when calling from the command shell; typically you will want to see the full return values from the playbook execution. Adding `-vvv` to the playbook call will print the module's return data back to the command shell (stdout). We will call the `03_aci_tenant_policies_pb.yml` as we did the previous playbooks, but this time increase the verbosity to see the results.

Follow along in your command shell to execute the Tenant Networking Playbook
>Make sure to use the same Tenant name you used for the previous playbooks

```
$ ansible-playbook 03_aci_tenant_policies_pb.yml -i inventory -vvv

We have shown just the first task from the first play, but the module execution outputs the same type of data for each task that is ran. Looking at the returned results, the data returned matches what was covered earlier in this lab. In this example, the existing value is an empty list since the object did not exist. Also, proposed and config dictionaries are mostly identical (the identifier is used in the URL, so it is not passed in the final request).
