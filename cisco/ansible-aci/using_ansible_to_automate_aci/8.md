## ACI REST API Commands
The Ansible ACI library offers modules to support the most commonly managed objects in ACI. The `aci_rest` module was created to fill the gaps where the current modules do not support a particular feature. We will show you how to use this module to make API requests to the APIC; if you are unfamiliar with this API, then checkout the ACI labs available from DevNet.
>Also, if you have a feature that you would like to see supported by the ACI modules, we encourage you to either open a feature request through GitHub, or develop the new module and submit a Pull Request.

### ACI REST Module
The `aci_rest` module provides a way to make any GET, POST, or DELETE request to the APIC using either XML or JSON. This module has just a few parameters that it accepts:
* `method:` The HTTP Method for the request (GET, POST, or DELETE)
* `path:` The URL for the API request
* `src:` Can be used to provide the body of a POST request using a file
* `content:` Can be used to provide the body of the POST request in the task

Open the `06_aci_rest_pb.yml` and change the **CHANGEME** in `path` parameter to be the value of the Tenant that you have been working on in this lab.

```yaml
---
- name: USE ACI REST MODULE
  hosts: apic
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False

  tasks:
    - name: ENSURE TENANT HAS L3 EXTERNAL NETWORK
      aci_rest:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        validate_certs: False
        method: "post"
        path: "api/mo/uni/tn-CHANGEME/out-corp_l3.json"
        content: {"l3extOut": {"attributes": {"descr":"Created Using Ansible", "name":"corp_l3"}}}
```

This playbook is used to add a Layer 3 External Network to your Tenant. This request is very basic, and just creates the shell of the External Network, but the module itself allows you to put as many configuration parameters in the request as you want. The module does not perform any checks for accuracy, so if the URL or Content is not valid, then the request will fail.

Go ahead and execute this playbook:

```bash
$ ansible-playbook 06_aci_rest_pb.yml -i inventory

ok: [sandboxapicdc.cisco.com] => {
    "changed": false, 
    "error_code": 0, 
    "error_text": "Success", 
    "failed": false, 
    "imdata": [], 
    "invocation": {
        "module_args": {
            "content": "{\"l3extOut\": {\"attributes\": {\"descr\":\"Created Using Ansible\", \"name\":\"corp_l3\"}}}", 
            "host": "sandboxapicdc.cisco.com", 
            "hostname": "sandboxapicdc.cisco.com", 
            "method": "post", 
            "password": "VALUE_SPECIFIED_IN_NO_LOG_PARAMETER", 
            "path": "api/mo/uni/tn-js_10018/out-corp_l3.json", 
            "protocol": "https", 
            "src": null, 
            "timeout": 30, 
            "use_proxy": true, 
            "use_ssl": true, 
            "username": "admin", 
            "validate_certs": false
        }
    }, 
    "response": "OK (30 bytes)", 
    "status": 200, 
    "totalCount": "0"
}
$ 
```

### Lab Cleanup

In order to cleanup the configurations for this lab, you will use the `aci_rest` module to make a DELETE request for your Tenant. Open up the `07_lab_cleanup.yml` playbook and edit the **CHANGEME** in `path` parameter to be the value of the Tenant that you have been working on in this lab.

```yaml
---
- name: USE ACI REST MODULE
  hosts: apic
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False

  tasks:
    - name: ENSURE LAB WORK IS CLEANED UP
      aci_rest:
        host: "{{ inventory_hostname }}"
        username: "{{ username }}"
        password: "{{ password }}"
        method: "delete"
        validate_certs: False
        path: "api/mo/uni/tn-CHANGEME.json"
```

Execute this playbook and your Tenant and all configuration will be removed from the lab APIC.

```
$ ansible-playbook 07_lab_cleanup.yml -i inventory
